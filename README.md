# JBChatAdmin

A shorted, lite version of Jerry Bot made for group chat administration.  

## Usage

### I have a group -

Add Jerry Bot https://www.facebook.com/jerry.bot.100 to your group. 

### I want to add myself/others to a group

Message Jerry Bot (or post in a group that he's in) the following command -

`!add <user_id> <thread_id>`

### Adding someone else to a chat you're already in

`!add <user_id> this` (in the chat you want to add them to)

`!add 124543 this`

- you must start a group, you cannot add people to 1 on 1 messages

### Adding yourself to a group

`!add me <thread_id>`

`!add me 12324354657`

### Finding User ID

I used this tool - https://commentpicker.com/find-facebook-id.php

I have no affiliation with this tool nor am I sponsored by it.

### Finding Thread ID

The thread id is the large number in the url of the messenger group

`https://www.messenger.com/t/1940745902642796`

It would be `1940745902642796`


## Data privacy 

I do not store any information past the messages you send to Jerry bot (mostly for debugging).  If you send Jerry Bot a message, I may read (though I probably won't.). If you ask me why you weren't added to a group, I may read the message. If you send personal information to Jerry bot then ask me to read the message, I will have your personal information.  Please do not send me personal information.  

If you are in the EU, and would like to see the messages you have sent to JerryBot by using GDPR instead of just looking at the messages you sent, I will send you the messages.
